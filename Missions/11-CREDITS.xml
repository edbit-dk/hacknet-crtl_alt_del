I have been watching your process from nobody to a very skilled hacker!

Therefore, I'm happy to congratulate you on having completed "WarGames".
Thank you for defeating WOPR and preventing WW3!

Hope you liked the game(s)!
New programs have been added to the Tech Lab - maybe take a look?

Goodbye - maybe we meet again?

Now, roll credits!
