Having successfully managed to escape from NORAD, you now try to locate Falken.

You find a pay phone (which you phreak of course) and call directories. 
They find no listing for Robert Hume or Stephen Falken on Goose Island, Oregon. 

You know that you will have to travel there, but you have no money - so you call Jennifer. 

You tell Jennifer that you are in Colorado and ask her if she can lend you the money to buy an airline ticket from Grand Junction Colorado to Oregon.  

You tell Jennifer that you will pick the ticket up from the airport, but she decides to meet you there in person anyway. 

You both make your way to Oregon, where you get the last ferry that day across to Goose Island. 
When you get to Goose Island, you meet a man who is flying a remote control Pterodactyl (as you do!). 

You ask the man if he knows where you can find Dr. Robert Hume. 
The man asks you to leave his land, but then you ask him if he's Stephen Falken - and tell him you've come because of Joshua...


Use Jennifers computer to find your way to Falken.

Reply back when you have found his terminal.
