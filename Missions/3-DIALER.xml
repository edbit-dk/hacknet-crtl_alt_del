Congratulations, you have successfully found a way to Sunnyvale, California. 

Now, before you attempt to SCAN and hack into any of the systems you have found in Sunnyvale, it's time to take a break. 
You decide to go to the arcade and play some Galaga - where you bump into Jennifer. 
Jennifer says she changed her mind and does want you to change her grade after all (I did try and tell you).

Jennifer comes back to your house where your computer screen is on the SCAN program. 
She asks what it's doing, to which you reply, it's "scanning IP adresses". 

Jennifer asks if it will take long as she is keen to get her grade changed (maybe you already changed it?). 

Now check the SCAN results and try to CONNECT to all the systems you have found.


Reply back when you -think- you are done.
