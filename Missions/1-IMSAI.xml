<note title="HELP">
HELP
1) Programs/commands like "CONNECT" are run by typing them in the "TERMINAL"-window (with the blinking cursor).
2) Note that you do not need to type commands in all-caps - like "CONNECT" vs "connect".
3) Type "?" or "HELP" to get a list of available commands.
4) In help messages, "[]" signifies arguments to commands - like "CONNECT [ip]".
5) Type "CLEAR" to clear terminal.

TIPS
1) Have a pen and paper beside you, when you need to write things down!
2) Read/download everything you can. Maybe it will become useful later!
3) Remember to clear your traces by removing ALL logs (rm *) from connected systems. You can stop an active trace by disconnecting!
4) When hacking systems you can run multiple programs at once as long you don't run out of RAM!
5) Take your time to read articles about security to understand them better!
