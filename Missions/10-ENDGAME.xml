No impact! 

We are still alive, but WOPR (Joshua) is still playing the game. 
He is trying to find the launch codes so he can launch the missiles himself...

We have to STOP him before he does!

Let him play "TIC TAC TOE" - that is the only way we can teach Joshua about futility in a nuclear war!

Hurry up - and good luck!
