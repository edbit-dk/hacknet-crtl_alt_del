Of course, the man is Stephen Falken. 

He invites you in and then proceeds to tell you a story about dinosaurs 
and tries to convince you that nuclear war is inevitable. 

All you want him to do is make a phone call to explain to NORAD what is really happening: that it's just a computer simulation! 

When it appears that your attempts to convince Falken to help are futile, you decide to leave. 

You look for a boat and in the absence of that Jennifer suggests you swim. 
You decline, telling her that you never learned how to swim and that you thought you'd always have plenty of time. 

Then you hear a chopper and the ground is lit up by search lights. 
You assume that Falken has turned you in, but then you realise that it is Falken piloting the chopper. 
Falken calls you on the PA and tells you to get in. 
You then proceed to fly to NORAD. 

You get to NORAD, but barely make it in time, before they lock down the mountain and seal the blast doors. 

At NORAD, Stephen Falken looks at the screens in the War Room, before announcing to General Beringer that the missiles are phantoms; a fantasy, a computer enhanced hallucination - and asks him to call it off. 

The General agrees to ride out the attack, before launching the missiles...


Reply back when you have talked with the General.
