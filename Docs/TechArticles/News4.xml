  <posting title="Firewall Analysis and Solutions">
Firewalls have been around for a very long time in computer security, most often serving to prevent automated foreign network traffic rather than secure against dedicated hackers.
Modern firewalls however can be configured to prevent *all* security-critical traffic unless it is prefixed by a firewall solution (often referred to as a password to end-users - though there is a distinct difference between the two).

In this situation, the firewall solution will need to be provided before an unsyndicated login attempt can be attempted - effectively meaning that any known password cracking software will be useless while a firewall is active.

Firewall complexity can be examined with the "analyze" command - running the analyze command multiple times will automatically detect patterns in the response data headers and will eliminate characters it can guarantee are not a part of the correct firewall solution.
Once a potential solution is found, the command "solve [FIREWALL_SOLUTION]" can be used to attempt to syndicate
