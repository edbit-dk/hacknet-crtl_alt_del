  <posting title="Proxy Servers - Advanced">
Proxy servers are essentially a secondary computer that you connect to a target through, which filters and caches network traffic to provide security and increase web performance on highly-requested information.

Proxies are configured by default to ward off traffic that might be considered a network threat (such at FTP Flooding), at the cost of needing to whitelist desirable traffic (such as youtube video streaming traffic).
This means that while they can be inconvenient for some users while they are being correctly configured, they can entirely prevent the execution of programs that could compromise a port or security service.

The most well-recognized flaw in proxy servers is their upper memory limit - which reached will force them to either entirely shut down the network they are connected do (a feature which is hardly ever utilized) or allow unchecked traffic to pass through.
Because of this, increasing network security budgets have led to more robust proxy servers with significantly more memory, making the process of overloading one a long and daunting task, nigh impossible with a single machine.
